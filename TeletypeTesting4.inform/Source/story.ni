[Adding Starship to the Hal Satellite]

[******to do********
Fix the UHF and Teletype being turned on truth table logic.  THIS SHOULD PRODUCE NO TTY OUTPUT WHEN UHF IS OFF.  ONLY PUT STATIC OUTPUT WHEN UHF IS ON, TTY IS ON, AND USER ISN"T HOLDING THE FREQ BOOK.

Include Basic Screen Effects by Emily Short.
Include ComputersTeletype by Dan Bowen
[This ComputersTeletype extension v9 is based on v8 of Computers by Emily Short.  There are only 2 things added: the variables visibleDescriptor and screenDescriptor.  The default to "visible" and "screen".  These appear when a multiple-choice menu is displayed.  In the story you change them to whatever text you like.  In this case, it's "printed" and "paper.]
[v10 by dan adds fixed spacing font for printing the choices of the menu inside the extension]
 

Book 1 - Hamshack - HAL-Starship

Part 1 - External Variables Setup [duplicated from main program]

Ham Shack is a room.
There is a roll of paper tape in the ham shack.
UHF Radio is in the ham shack.  UHF radio is a device.  UHF radio is switched on.

The Radiostation is below the Ham Shack.
The AM Transmitter is a device in the Radiostation.  AM Transmitter is switched on.
The AM Transmitter Frequency is initially 1070.
 
Part 2 - Teletype

[Interaction begins when player examines Teletype ]


The Teletype is computer in the ham shack.  The teletype is switched off.  The description is "The teletype is a green boxy thing, with a typwriter keyboard, paper coming out the top, and a paper tape reader on the side.[if the teletype is switched on]The motor hums quietly.[otherwise] It is turned off."

Understand "paper", "message", "text" and "readout" as a screen.
Understand "tty" as teletype.


The paper tape reader is an extension port.  It is part of the teletype.  the description of the paper tape reader is "The punched paper tape reader is a bulging box hanging off the left side of the main teletype. It is used to transmit large amounts pre-recorded data through the teletype."

The roll of paper tape is a data storage device.

After switching on the teletype:
	if UHF is switched on:
		[These lines are here to change the menu text to printed on paper, a la teletype ]
		Now screenDescriptor is "paper";
		Now the visibleDescriptor is "printed";
			[** this next line is important to start the main menut **]
		if OSBroken is true:
			now halNotice is "[halBootloaderIntro]";
			now the teletype runs HAL-Bootloader program;
		if OSBroken is false:
			now halNotice is "[halOSIntro]";
	if UHF is switched off:
		now the teletype runs Static;
	Try examining teletype;
